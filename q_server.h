/*
 * rayforce-q — Q IPC wire-format server for RayforceDB. The mirror of q.h.
 *
 * Where q.h lets you call a Q server, this lets you be one: a Q client or
 * rayforce-q's own q_connect sends a char-vector, the server evaluates it as a
 * *Rayfall* statement against the embedded runtime, and returns the result
 * Q-encoded. The Q runtime is only the transport.
 *
 * Like q.c, this is language-neutral C shared across bindings: a binding that
 * wants to host a Q server compiles q_server.c (alongside q.c, whose codec it
 * reuses) and calls q_serve() with the runtime's poll. The shipped rayforce
 * binary does exactly that behind `rayforce -q PORT`
 *
 * The listener is non-blocking and runs entirely on the rayforce poll you
 * hand it — the same event loop the REPL and native IPC use — so it never
 * spawns a thread. Every request is evaluated on the poll thread, serialized
 * with the rest of the runtime.

 * Attaching a connected fd to the poll removes that restriction. The event
